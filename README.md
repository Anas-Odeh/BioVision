# BioVision: universal deep learning software for medical image classification and segmentation across diverse imaging modalities in biomedicine

**BioVision** is a cutting-edge, standalone deep learning software platform that leverages YOLOv11 object detection models and fine-tuned SAM 2.1 for high-performance instance segmentation across diverse biological applications and imaging modalities.

## üî¨ Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Support**: Works across ultrasound, X-ray, MRI, electron microscopy, and brightfield microscopy
- **Cancer Diagnostics**: Accurate classification and segmentation of breast cancer (X-ray mammography) and brain tumors (MRI)
- **Comprehensive Organ Segmentation**: Supports 34 human organs and 8 mouse tissues from histology datasets
- **Fetal Biometry**: Precise fetal structure segmentation in ultrasound images for developmental assessment
- **Cellular Analysis**: White blood cell classification and subcellular structure segmentation (mitochondria)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive GUI with both segmentation and classification workflows

## üéØ Applications

### Medical Diagnostics
- **Breast Cancer Detection**: 88.5% classification accuracy, 100% segmentation accuracy
- **Brain Tumor Analysis**: 99.5% classification accuracy, 97.5% segmentation accuracy
- **Fetal Development**: 99% accuracy in fetal structure segmentation

### Research Applications
- **Histopathology**: Automated tissue identification across diverse organ systems
- **Hematology**: 99.4% accuracy in white blood cell classification
- **Cellular Biology**: Precise mitochondria segmentation in EM images
- **Comparative Biology**: Cross-species anatomical mapping

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

BioVision employs a sophisticated two-stage architecture:

1. **Stage 1**: Custom-trained YOLOv11 models for robust object detection and region proposal
2. **Stage 2**: Fine-tuned SAM 2.1 models for precise boundary delineation and instance segmentation

## üìä Performance Highlights
